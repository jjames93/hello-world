Greeting!

My name is Jasmine, and I am on an ambitious path to teach myself computer science concepts as well as code.
My aim is to have be at a junior front-end dev level by Hallow's Eve.

I am open to all tips and lessons learned from anyone who has been in my position.

Here's to taking control of your future!
